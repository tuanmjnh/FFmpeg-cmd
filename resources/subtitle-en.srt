00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,160
What is the name of the drunkard?

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:10,439
What is the bitterness? Vuong Bao, from his heart full of love, his head is

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:15,000

00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:18,600

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,400
don&#39;t bother to marry

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:30,599
a flower and play far away from the scene. After the green day, I have to be

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:35,280
with a new person. I&#39;m happy with someone who still has the King for

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,369
me. Even if life is absent from me, my heart

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,740
won&#39;t be able to face

11
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,739
[music]

12
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,780
[music]

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,320
or the way we know each other, we won&#39;t be together.

14
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:05,719
Being far away means we&#39;ve

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:10,000
been together for a long time. If we&#39;re not together, we&#39;ll forget it. But the day you

16
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,959
walk away, it&#39;s because of the ice season.  Where is the

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,079


18
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:18,719


19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,438


20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:26,679
wind taking the boat to the other side? It&#39;s a desolate,

21
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:30,599
melancholy port. We&#39;re

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:34,640
separated from each other, holding on to so many regrets. Which goat mountain is

23
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:37,399
for the drunkard?

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,399
Where&#39;s the good place? The King&#39;s heart is full of heartbreak and first love. I don&#39;t

25
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:45,359
see if it&#39;s the cause.  Time changes, I don&#39;t know who&#39;s there, the deep and

26
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:48,920
deep still remain forever, the

27
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,920
pain I ask, the sky is sad, I

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,759
don&#39;t even want to let the wind fly, I don&#39;t even bother to be a flower and play far

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:01,079
away, after the green day, I have to be with a new person, I&#39;m

30
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:05,079
happy with someone who is still King of this place

31
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,789
Even though life is absent from my morning sun, my heart can&#39;t

32
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:11,158
face

[music]

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,759
or my hand has not forgotten the warmth of my kiss. Picking

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,439
up people, quickly moving across,

37
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:38,719
happy, different love, where will the wind take the boat?

38
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:42,280
Desolate harbor.  I&#39;m so sad that we&#39;re

39
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:45,878
far away from each other, holding on to all the regrets and tenderness

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,959
for those who are drunk and bitter. Where&#39;s the

41
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,479
little thing that&#39;s missing? The heart of our first love, I

42
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,719
can&#39;t see it. Is it the world? Thy

43
00:02:52,479 --> 00:03:00,119
knows who? The depth of her womb is still there

44
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:04,080
forever. The sadness.  The pain is still there, Hoa is sad, a thousand

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,759
planes stopped flying on that death anniversary, I don&#39;t bother to take la

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,920
flowers, not far away, the scene after the green day is less exposed to the

47
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:16,679
new side, I&#39;m happy with anyone, no one is attached to

48
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:19,479
this place, even though life is empty and bright, my heart is

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:24,080
not gentle or

50
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:27,560
gentle.  For drunk people who are C,

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,799
there is no place to miss. Phuong always guides love from his heart,

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,400
but he doesn&#39;t see if it&#39;s the world that&#39;s

53
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:39,040
replaced. Who knows? Where can he confide that the deep feeling is still

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,840
good? The pain still asks God, sadly, he

55
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,878
hangs up, the other number doesn&#39;t bother to take it.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:51,319
After the green day, I had to be with a

57
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:56,000
new person. I&#39;m happy with everyone. I&#39;m still in

58
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:58,679
this place. Even though life is absent, my heart

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,259
can&#39;t

cry with all your sorrows.

00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:49,639
When a girl loves someone with all her heart, she can&#39;t

70
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:54,759
decide what&#39;s right. They

71
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:58,600
only tease you for a few

72
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,199

00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:35,318
uninvited and sad, why do you always come so quickly, flowers and cheers,

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,240
life screams and roars, look

00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:43,840
behind you, you&#39;re not alone, baby,

83
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:47,800
stop crying and cry for

84
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:51,638
those who deceived others.  If it&#39;s just for the night,

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:57,800
just let it go until it&#39;s

86
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,800

you know, baby, don&#39;t cry, think about it,

89
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,639
but when you&#39;re with me, when you

90
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:24,079
know they&#39;re just teasing you, he

91
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:29,918
shouts and then your father runs away.  Following the

92
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:34,800
fragrant flowers you know, why are you so close? My heart is heavy because that

93
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:39,079
person really hurts me, do you

know? How similar is that person to you?

95
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:47,758

others and deceiving others  If we&#39;ve reached the end of the night, then

103

Please stop crying. Tears

01:00:53,159 --> 01:01:03,920
I will love you forever  I also fly back with the wind.

710
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:07,400
I don&#39;t want to cry. Just because I regret the

711
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:12,159
days we spent

712
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:15,639
together, time has erased the pain. I

713
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:20,798
wonder if

714
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:25,279
fate will forgive me. My

715
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:29,199
happy friend,

716
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:34,200
I would sell it to get a pension.

717
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:40,558


718
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:43,759


719
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:52,200


720
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:55,440
If you can, please don&#39;t hurt each other

721
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:59,439
because life is

722
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:03,440
so long, who knows what tomorrow will bring

723
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:07,519


724
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:14,318
?  It&#39;s bittersweet in the

725
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:23,358
next life, but we&#39;ll never be together again. The

726
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:30,358
pain in our body is still too much.

727
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:34,119
So how can our feelings hurt? The

728
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:38,278
heart wants to say a

729
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:42,920
word that I want to be with you for the rest of my

730
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:48,440
life. Love each other in the last life.

731
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:48,440
Hey, please don&#39;t go

732
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:55,650


733
01:02:53,358 --> 01:03:21,558

[music]

735
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:29,000
Will fate

736
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:32,358
forgive me? My

737
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:37,440
happy friend

738
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:42,480
I sold in exchange for my retirement.

739
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:48,838
Do you regret it just because of a few

740
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:52,119
impatient moments?  dreaming of someone who has

741
01:03:48,838 --> 01:04:00,199
the whole city of Xan with me

742
01:03:52,119 --> 01:04:03,798
If possible, please don&#39;t hurt each other

743
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:07,719
because life is

744
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:11,719
long, who knows tomorrow

745
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:15,759
? No one can live through

746
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:23,199
losing each other once. It&#39;s

747
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:31,200
bittersweet, and we won&#39;t be able to be together in the next life.  When we

748
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:38,358
hurt our bodies, it hurts too

749
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:42,118
quickly, so our feelings are hurt, what should we do? My

750
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:46,639
heart wants to say a

751
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:51,160
word, I want to be with you for the rest of my

752
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:55,679
life, love each other in this

753
01:04:51,159 --> 01:05:04,278
life, please don&#39;t make an appointment to go far

754
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:07,719
away. The wound is so painful, it&#39;s still painful.  It&#39;s so

755
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:11,798
fast, our feelings are

756
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:18,118
hurt, what should we do?

757
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:19,798
My heart wants to say a word, I want to be with you for

758
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:25,318
the rest of my

759
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:27,920
life, love each other in this life,

760
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:27,920
please don&#39;t let

761
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,119
